Nautical War is a simple game where you try to sink the enemy's ships before they sink yours.  The game is played on a 10x10 grid.  Each player has 5 ships: a carrier (5 squares), a battleship (4 squares), a cruiser (3 squares), a submarine (3 squares), and a destroyer (2 squares).  The ships are placed on the grid by the players and then the players take turns firing at the enemy's ships.  The first player to sink all of the enemy's ships wins.

Nautical War used to be commercial software, but I've decided to release it as open source under an [MIT License](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gdonald/nauticalwar/main/LICENSE).
